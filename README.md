# Vert.x Chat

A very simplistic chat that uses the SockJS client-side bridge and mod-web-server.

Run it with `mvn vertx:runModEclipse` (or `mvn vertx:runModIdea` or `mvn vertx:runMod`) and point a few browser windows to http://localhost:8080/. You should see chat messages appear in all windows simultaneously.
